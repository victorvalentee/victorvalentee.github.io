    Hi! My name is Victor. I am a senior data engineer and an enthusiast of software craftsmanship and design. 
    I strive for writing code that is both useful and beautiful to look at, or as I like to call it, <em>katana-code</em>.
  </p>

  <div id="katana-code-principles">
    <h2>Katana-code Principles</h2>
    <p>The following are the main principles that guide my reasoning and behavior when building, delivering, and maintaining software.</p>

    <h3>Kaizen</h3>
    <p>
      <em>
        "A complex system that works invariably evolved from a simple system that worked."
      </em> &mdash; John Gall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Start with a working combination of processes, design, and code. 
      Deploy. 
      Make gradual improvements to this combination. 
      Repeat until the result is satisfactory.
    </p>

    <h3>Integrity</h3>
    <p>
      <em>
        "If they are going to use our swords, I shall make one that will not break."
      </em> &mdash; Amakuni Yasutsuna, legendary swordsmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aim for clear specs, type-safety, controlled side-effects, proper error handling, thorough testing,
      reproducible builds, continuous integration and delivery.
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      <em>
        "As we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.
        It is purpose that created us. That guides us. That drives us. It is purpose that defines us."
      </em> &mdash; Agent Smith, a piece of software.
    </p>
    <p>
      A software product is a tool. Its value is not in itself, but in its ability to fulfill the real-world need that birthed it.
      Solid MVV statements and clear OKRs go a long way in keeping what's really important in the forefront.
    </p>

    <h3>Elegance</h3>
    <p>
      <em>
        "When I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong."
      </em> &mdash; R. Buckminster Fuller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elegant creations reflect the character of the creator. In the era of AI slop, I prioritize beauty, expressiveness, and clarity.
    </p>

    <h3>Unity</h3>
    <p>
      <em>
        "A system can't be more coherent than the team that builds it."
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The best software development teams (or any kind of team, for that matter) operate as one single organism.
      I aim to build teams where the standards are high, communication is effective and fluid, responsibilities are well-defined, well-distributed, and well-executed.
