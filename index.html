          Hi! My name is Victor. I am a senior data engineer and an enthusiast of software craftsmanship and design.
          I strive for writing code that is both useful and beautiful to look at, or as I like to call it, <em>katana-code</em>.
        </p>

        <div id="katana-code-principles">
          <h2>Katana-code Principles</h2>
          <p>The following are the main principles that guide my reasoning and behavior when building, delivering, and maintaining software.</p>

          <h3>Kaizen</h3>
          <p>
            <em>
              "A complex system that works invariably evolved from a simple system that worked."
            </em> &mdash; John Gall.
          </p>

          <p>
            Start with a working combination of processes, design, and code.
            Deploy.
            Make gradual improvements to this combination.
            Repeat until the result is satisfactory.
          </p>

          <h3>Integrity</h3>
          <p>
            <em>
              "If they are going to use our swords, I shall make one that will not break."
            </em> &mdash; Amakuni Yasutsuna, legendary swordsmith.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aim for clear specs, type-safety, controlled side-effects, proper error handling, thorough testing,
            reproducible builds, continuous integration and delivery.
          </p>

          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            <em>
              "As we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.
              It is purpose that created us. That guides us. That drives us. It is purpose that defines us."
            </em> &mdash; Agent Smith, a piece of software.
          </p>
          <p>
            A software product is a tool. Its value is not in itself, but in its ability to fulfill the real-world need that birthed it.
            Solid MVV statements and clear OKRs go a long way in keeping what's really important in the forefront.
          </p>

          <h3>Elegance</h3>
          <p>
            <em>
              "When I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong."
            </em> &mdash; R. Buckminster Fuller.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elegant creations reflect the character of the creator. In the era of AI slop, I prioritize beauty, expressiveness, and clarity.
          </p>

          <h3>Unity</h3>
          <p>
            <em>
              "A system can't be more coherent than the team that builds it."
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The best software development teams (or any kind of team, for that matter) operate as one single organism.
            I aim to build teams where the standards are high, communication is effective and fluid, responsibilities are well-defined, well-distributed, and well-executed.
